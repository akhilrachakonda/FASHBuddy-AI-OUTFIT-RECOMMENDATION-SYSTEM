# FASHBuddy – AI Outfit Recommendation System 👗🤖

FASHBuddy is an AI-powered personalized outfit recommendation system that leverages computer vision and machine learning to suggest clothing tailored to a user's physical attributes and preferences. It simplifies fashion decisions by analyzing inputs like height, weight, dress size, skin tone, occasion, and a photograph.

## 🌟 Features

- 📸 **Image-Based Analysis**: Detects face shape, shoulder width, waistline, and skin tone from a user-uploaded photo.
- 🧠 **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests outfits based on body shape, skin tone, and occasion using ML algorithms.
- 🎨 **Color Matching**: Recommends colors that complement the user's skin tone.
- 🧵 **Style Matching**: Matches face shape to necklines, shoulder type to sleeve styles, and waistline to bottom cuts.
- 🔁 **Feedback Loop**: Incorporates user feedback to refine future recommendations.
- 🔍 **Bing Image Search Integration**: Fetches real-world outfit images matching the recommendations.
